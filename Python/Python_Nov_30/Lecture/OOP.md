## parts of OOP
- classes -> blueprint
- attributes -> things that make up our class
- methods -> actions that can be taken upon a class
- self -> references the instance of the class NOT
- dunder init (constructor function)

## classes
__what is a class__: is like a blueprint
1. house
1. legos
1. car

```py
snake_case

class house:
    def __init__(self):
        self.bedroom_count
        self.framing_style
        self.num_of_floors

tylers_house = House()

```
